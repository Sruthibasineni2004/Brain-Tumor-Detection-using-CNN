# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-CNN
## 📌Project Overview
 
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze MRI scans for the detection of brain tumors. The model is trained on a dataset containing MRI images categorized as tumorous and non-tumorous to assist in early diagnosis.

## 📂Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing consists of MRI scan images categorized into:

✅ Tumorous – MRI images containing brain tumors

✅ Non-Tumorous – MRI images without tumors

The dataset is extracted from a ZIP file and preprocessed for CNN training.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
### Programming Language: 
Python
### Libraries Used:
TensorFlow & Keras – Model training
NumPy – Data handling
Matplotlib – Visualization
scikit-learn – Data preprocessing
OpenCV & PIL – Image processing
## 🔧 Project Workflow
⿡ Dataset Extraction – MRI images extracted and loaded into a structured format.

⿢ Data Preprocessing – Images resized, converted to arrays, and labels assigned.

⿣ Model Architecture – CNN model with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, and Dense layers.

⿤ Training & Validation – Model trained on preprocessed MRI images.

⿥ Evaluation & Prediction – Model tested for accuracy and real-time tumor detection.
